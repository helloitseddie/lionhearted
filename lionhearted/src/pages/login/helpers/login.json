  "line1":"Lionfish threaten our native species and the coral reefs they depend on. I made this website both for ShellHacks 2021 and to serve as a one stop shop for helping and motivating people to put a stop to the lionfish invasion. First and foremost, The Coral Safari is a lionfish geotagging website. Like a mix of Waze and blockchain, it relies on its users to tag lionfish and verify other tags, making finding lionfish easier than ever before. The Coral Safari also serves as a recipe hub for lionfish. Lionfish is easily one of the best tasting fish in the ocean (I would say it is the best), it's only a matter of getting enough people to taste it. When Chef Paul Prudhomme invented his blackened redfish seasoning it converted the redfish, an otherwise average fish, into a delicacy. This led to it being fished to near extinction. That would have been tragic, but The Coral Safari aims to harness and divert that energy against the lionfish. All we need to do is motivate people.",
  "line3": "Future plans for this project include user profiles, a mobile app, wider outreach, and maybe support for more types of invasive species. The next big thing, however, is a plan to highlight different chefs from different establishments all across the south with a 'lionfish recipe of the month' as a way to motive people to eat lionfish and restaurants to serve lionfish.",
